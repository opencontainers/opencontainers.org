# Connect with the Open Container Initiative community

The technical community working on developing standards around container formats and runtime technology.  Get Involved!

## Open meetings

The technical community hosts a weekly open meeting, currently held on Thursdays at 10:00 AM (US Pacific). Everyone is welcome to participate. The Zoom link and our agenda are maintained on our [HackMD page](https://hackmd.io/El8Dd2xrTlCaCG59ns5cwg), and everyone is welcome to propose additional topics or suggest other agenda alterations there. Minutes are embedded in the HackMD document and recordings are made available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpGceic1q4-3Tai0kgeBcwg) for those who are unable to join the call.

## Mailing list 

- [Google Group (developer community)](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/dev)

## Chat 

Given the existence of both pre-Slack communication via IRC and the adoption of Slack by many communities, we have a bridge between the
IRC channel #opencontainers on freenode.net and the #general channel on [OCI Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/opencontainers/join-the-oci-community). For Matrix users, this channel
is also bridged to #opencontainers:matrix.org.
