The OCI wrapped up a great 2022 and our last community F2F meeting was held at KubeCon in Detroit: https://hackmd.io/nZzK_4AfRz-xgya6KkqseA 

We were proud to complete the OCI Reference Types Working Group which resulted in improvements to two of the specifications:

* opencontainers/distribution-spec#335
* opencontainers/image-spec#934

To kick off 2023, we are excited to announce the following four board members are joining or returning to the [OCI Technical Oversight Board (TOB)](https://opencontainers.org/about/tob). The TOB comprises independently elected individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal. Each member has been elected to serve a two-year term:

* Aleksa Sarai [SUSE]
* Brandon Mitchell [IBM]
* Derek McGowan [Apple]
* Vincent Batts [Microsoft]

These TOB members join the following existing members, who are each in the middle of two-year terms:

* Josh Dolitsky [Chainguard]
* Phil Estes [Amazon]
* Jon Johnson [Google]
* Samuel Karp [Google]
* Nisha Kumar [Oracle]

For outgoing TOB members, we would like to [thank](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/main/EMERITUS.md) Tycho Andersen for their contributions to container standardization!

In 2023, we plan on focusing efforts on improved conformance tooling, security and shipping v1.1 of the OCI specifications. Join us in Seattle at [CloudNativeSecurityCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloudnativesecuritycon-north-america/)!
