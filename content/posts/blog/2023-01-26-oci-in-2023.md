The OCI wrapped up a great 2022 and our last community F2F meeting was held at KubeCon in Detroit: https://hackmd.io/nZzK_4AfRz-xgya6KkqseA 

We were proud to complete the OCI Reference Types Working Group which resulted in improvements to two of the specifications:

* opencontainers/distribution-spec#335
* opencontainers/image-spec#934

To kick off 2023, we are excited to announce the following four board members are joining or returning to the [OCI Technical Oversight Board (TOB)](https://opencontainers.org/about/tob). The TOB comprises independently elected individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal. Each member has been elected to serve a two-year term:

* Aleksa Sarai [SUSE]
* Brandon Mitchell [IBM]
* Derek McGowan [Apple]
* Vincent Batts [Microsoft]

These TOB members join the following existing members, who are each in the middle of two-year terms:

* Josh Dolitsky [Chainguard]
* Phil Estes [Amazon]
* Jon Johnson [Google]
* Samuel Karp [Amazon]
* Nisha Kumar [Oracle]

For outgoing TOB members, we would like to [thank](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/main/EMERITUS.md) Tycho Andersen for their contributions to container standardization!

In 2023, we plan on focusing efforts on improved conformance tooling, security and shipping v1.1 of the OCI specifications.
