Despite the challenges faced by the world in 2020, the OCI community pulled together for some exciting new developments to advance standards around containers. In addition to the community turning 5, we open sourced a [security audit of the runc](https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2020-01-31-open-sourcing-runc-security-audit/) tool and accepted a new project, [umoci](https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2020-08-03-umoci/) – which provides a way to create, manipulate and interact with container images. Also, we also developed and [open sourced the OCI Icon Set](https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2020-04-13-introducing-and-open-sourcing-the-oci-icon-set/) – which allows the wider community to build vendor-neutral container and cloud native diagrams.

To kick off 2021, we are excited to announce the following four board members are joining or returning to the [OCI Technical Oversight Board (TOB)](https://opencontainers.org/about/tob). The TOB comprises independently elected individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal. Each member has been elected to serve a two-year term:

*   Vincent Batts [Kinvolk] 
*   Derek McGowan [Apple]  
*   Aleksa Sarai  [SUSE]
*   Tycho Andersen [Cisco]

These TOB members join the following existing members, who are each in the middle of two-year terms:

*   Samuel Karp [AWS]
*   Phil Estes [AWS] (TOB Chair)
*   Jon Johnson [Google]
*   Wei Fu [Alibaba] 
*   Steve Lasker [Microsoft]

For outgoing TOB members, we would like to thank [Michael Crosby](https://github.com/crosbymichael) for his many years of service to the OCI.

According to a recent [report](https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-2021-container-security-usage-report/) from Sysdig, containerd and CRI-O both saw 200% growth over the past year as OCI powered projects grow. As we look to 2021, we plan to continue this growth and momentum.

In 2021, the OCI community plans to fund another security audit and will also launch a formal [OCI Distribution Conformance effort](https://conformance.opencontainers.org/distribution-spec/) to certify conformance of open source and commercial tools built on the OCI Distribution Specification that we aim to release v1.0 final this year.
