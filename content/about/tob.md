## Technical Oversight Board

The Technical Oversight Board (TOB) is responsible for managing conflicts, violations of procedures or guidelines and any cross-project or high-level issues that cannot be resolved in the TDC for OCI Projects.
The TOB shall also be responsible for adding, removing or reorganizing OCI Projects.

TOB members are directly elected by the maintainers of the OCI projects for two-year terms (staggered such that half of seats are up for election each year).
The TOB Chair is elected each year by the TOB and is responsible for organising TOB meetings and setting the agendas of said meetings.

You can follow the TOB's activities on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob) and on [their respective mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/tob).
The TOB holds infrequent meetings which are usually recorded and posted on [the primary OCI development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!forum/dev).
